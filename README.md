Thanks for stopping in!
Hi, I’m Shayla. I'm originally from Las Vegas, NV but I'm living in Utah right now as I finish college. 
I’m currently finishing my degree in Web Design & Development. I will finish in December 2022.
I love the creativity in coding. The things that can be built are endless and that makes me excited. 
I mostly work with JavaScript & JavaScript libraries. I also work with PHP and WordPress occasionally.
Take a look around at some of my projects. These are both personal & school projects I have completed by myself or with a group.
